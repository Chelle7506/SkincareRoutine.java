Skincare Routine Quiz
The program will recommend users skincare products based on their skin type and skin concerns. A description will also be included to give a general idea behind terminolgy, ingredients, and processes.

After inputting skin type and concerns, the program will generate five categories of products. Within each category such as cleanser, essence/toner, serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen will be a couple products that are recommended. While many of the products recommended may be similar, I tried to pick items
that can work for mulitple skin types to reduce the possibility of irritation or the product not being effective. It will ultimately depend on the person 
and their preference for which products they choose! This is just a little guide to help out people that may need some guidance on where to start!
